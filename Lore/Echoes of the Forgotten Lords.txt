Echoes of the Forgotten Lords

Before time was measured, before kingdoms rose and fell, there were the Old Lords—beings of incomprehensible form and purpose. Their presence shaped the world, their essence seeped into the land, and their whispers still linger in the hearts of those who seek the truth. But truth is elusive. No one knows if the gods were rulers, creators, or something beyond mortal understanding. All that remains are the echoes of their existence, carried through crumbling texts, forgotten relics, and the fervent beliefs of their followers.

The faithful cling to these echoes, each faction certain that their god was the true sovereign of an age lost to time.

The Mawborn speak of Xyrrith, the Hungering Maw, an unfathomable entity of endless consumption. To its followers, hunger is divine—both the hunger for power and the hunger that gnaws at the flesh. They believe the Maw is not dead, but waiting, biding its time beneath the surface of the world, whispering promises to those willing to feed it.

The Veil-Touched, scholars and mystics, dedicate their lives to Vaelisar, the Veilborn, the god of secrets and hidden knowledge. They believe that truth is not spoken but deciphered, that knowledge was never meant to be free. They claim Vaelisar is not gone, but fractured, existing in fleeting glimpses, in riddles, in the spaces between words. Those who claim to have heard its voice seldom return unchanged.

The Stormforged Legions march in the name of Thyrrak, the Stormforged Tyrant, a god of relentless order, a being of iron and unyielding might. Their teachings say that only through conquest can the world be whole again, that the Tyrant still watches, judging from the heavens, waiting for a worthy hand to raise the broken banners of the past.

The Children of the Bloom worship Ixmora, the Blooming Wound, a deity of unchecked growth, of nature both wondrous and terrifying. To them, decay is not death, but transformation, and civilization is a disease upon the land. They see ruins as sacred, places where Ixmora’s touch has reclaimed what was stolen, and they seek to spread the chaos of nature’s will.

These beliefs have shaped the world more than the gods themselves ever could. Wars have been waged, cities have crumbled, and still, the question remains—who were the Old Lords, truly? The wise claim that none can know for certain. The devout claim that they already do.

Some seek only to preserve the old ways, to tend to forgotten shrines and keep the stories alive. Others, however, search for something greater. Holy books, ancient relics, and whispers of forbidden rituals hint at the return of the gods. Some claim they never truly left. Others fear what it would mean if they did.

But in the end, belief is more powerful than truth. And in a world built upon forgotten echoes, belief is enough to shape reality itself.



1. Vorkhal, the Black Star
Followers: The Hollow Sun
Theme: Cosmic dread, fate, the inevitable
Vorkhal was never seen, only felt—a distant, blackened sun whose presence loomed over the heavens. The Hollow Sun believe the world was merely an ember from Vorkhal’s dying flame, and that in time, all will be drawn back into its lightless embrace. They do not worship in temples, for they claim true devotion requires solitude, the acceptance of oblivion. Their presence unsettles others, for they neither fear death nor resist it.

2. Ozaan, the God of the Still Waters
Followers: The Drowned Choir
Theme: Reflection, stagnation, the unknown depths
Ozaan is whispered of in places where the water does not move—deep lakes, forgotten wells, and flooded ruins. Its believers say the surface of the water holds the memory of the past, and that by gazing into its depths, one can see glimpses of what was lost. The Drowned Choir believe Ozaan waits beneath the surface, calling to those who listen too closely. Some claim they hear songs in the silence, hymns bubbling from unseen lips. Others simply disappear beneath the water, never to be seen again.

3. Nysira, the Gilded Serpent
Followers: The Scales of Nysira
Theme: Wealth, deception, divine judgment
Nysira was never a god of mercy, only of balance. The Scales believe that all debts must be repaid—whether in gold, blood, or soul. To them, wealth is not a luxury but a measure of devotion, for prosperity is a sign of Nysira’s favor, and poverty is punishment for a past transgression. It is said the most devoted of Nysira’s followers carry a golden scale, never letting it tip too far in one direction, lest they incur the goddess’s wrath.

4. Dremyss, the Dreaming One
Followers: The Waking Veil
Theme: Illusions, dreams, blurred reality
Dremyss does not speak, nor does it rule. It simply dreams, and in doing so, we exist. The Waking Veil believe reality is but the fleeting thoughts of their slumbering god, that the world is fragile and can be reshaped by those who understand its nature. Some claim to hear Dremyss whispering in their sleep, offering glimpses of a reality more true than this one. Others fear that if the god ever awakens, all will simply cease to be.

5. Kaelthys, the Thorned Empress
Followers: The Red Vow
Theme: Beauty, pain, sacrifice
Kaelthys is the goddess of the exquisite and the excruciating, the divine balance between suffering and splendor. The Red Vow believe true beauty is born of sacrifice—whether through flesh, devotion, or blood. Their rites are elaborate, their shrines adorned with thorned roses and silver mirrors. Some among them claim the Empress still walks among mortals, veiled in silk and shadow, seeking those worthy of her gaze.

6. Urak-Thol, the Silent Beast
Followers: The Bloodbound
Theme: Strength, instinct, survival of the fittest
Urak-Thol does not demand prayers, only obedience to the natural order. The Bloodbound see civilization as weakness, a betrayal of one’s true nature. They claim Urak-Thol never died, that it still walks the wilds in the form of the strongest beast, testing those who claim dominion over the land. Some warriors mark their bodies with deep scars, believing pain draws them closer to the god’s primal essence.

7. Zarethun, the Endless Hand
Followers: The Unbound
Theme: Knowledge, obsession, creation
Zarethun is the god of ceaseless invention, its form ever-shifting, its purpose never clear. The Unbound believe that to create is to touch the divine, that knowledge should never be hoarded but pursued relentlessly. They see no difference between genius and madness, claiming that Zarethun’s influence drives both. Many among them are artificers, sculptors, or scholars—some achieving great works, others lost to their own creations.

8. Veythis, the Waning Lord
Followers: The Pale Covenant
Theme: Time, inevitability, preservation
Veythis is not a god of change, but of stillness. The Pale Covenant believe all things are slowly fading, that the world itself is in its final breaths. They do not seek to prevent the inevitable but to preserve what little remains. Their halls are filled with relics of forgotten ages, their lives dedicated to ensuring nothing is lost before its time. Some claim they have seen Veythis’s shadow stretching across the land, a formless presence that watches, waiting for the last light to flicker out.

9. Ithiska, the Marionette Queen
Followers: The Threadborn
Theme: Fate, manipulation, unseen forces
Ithiska is the god of strings—both the ones that bind and the ones that control. The Threadborn believe free will is an illusion, that all are bound to the grand design of their Queen. Some embrace this, believing she has already woven their destiny. Others seek to sever their strings, to defy the fate she has crafted for them. It is said that those who stare too long into the void may see the threads that guide their steps… but few who do ever remain unchanged.

10. Ezkorel, the Ashen Witness
Followers: The Emberwake
Theme: Fire, destruction, rebirth
Ezkorel is neither cruel nor kind. It is simply fire—consuming, cleansing, eternal. The Emberwake do not fear destruction, for they believe it is only through ashes that new life can begin. They set great pyres in the name of their god, watching the flames as though seeking guidance in the embers. Some say Ezkorel does not destroy, but remembers, and that in the rising smoke, one might glimpse the past… or the future.
